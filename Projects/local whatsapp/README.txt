Local Whatsapp

This project will come close to how WhatsApp Web works. Try it out (if you haven't already)  
to get a feel of what you are going to build)

Guidelines -

1. Anshul has compiled a list of pretty relevant guidelines. Have a read before you proceed -  
https://github.com/Akamoha/OOP-Resources/blob/master/Projects/Group%20videochat%20webapp/README.md

2. Asking questions is very important. Make sure you know how everything works.  
Search for any unknown keywords that you come across. If you do not find results after an exhaustive search,  
do not hesitate to ask around in forums or at Q&A sites like StackOverflow.

How to proceed -

1. Try to come up with a very basic model for a particular functionality and  
then proceed towards the complicated part.
For eg., right now concentrate on how two end users can chat through a web browser.  
There are many chat applications/examples scattered over the Internet.

2. Logically, the project will be divided into three parts -  
the backend, the frontend and the "middle" part which glues the two together.
The backend will be the core application logic, written as Java classes.  
The frontend (JSP, Freemarker, etc) serve as a way to represent the result obtained from those classes.  
The middle part (web frameworks such as Spring, Dropwizard) allow you to glue these two together  
by providing flexible libraries for a RESTful web service.  
This is close to what is known as an MVC (Model-View-Controller) model.

Tools required (for installation instructions, read https://github.com/Akamoha/OOP-Resources/blob/master/README.md) -

1. Github -
	I cannot stress enough that understing Git/Github and how it works will go a long way enhancing your productivity.
	Lot of time gets wasted syncing the project when you email your code.
	https://help.github.com/
	Hands on tutorials - https://try.github.io/ or http://gitimmersion.com/
	https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
	Cheat sheet - https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf
	Misc. - https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/

2. Maven (for project management)
	Maven is a kind of dependency manager that takes care of importing and maintaing dependencies of libraries you will be using
	http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html

3. Dropwizard / Spring Boot (any one, web frameworks to make your life easier)
	Dropwizard - http://www.dropwizard.io/
	Spring Boot - http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/
	
4. Database
	Yet to be finalised

4. WebSockets and XMPP protocol
