These should get you started with using structured databases in Java. There is a lot of reading to be done, however. Get yourself acquainted with the jargon. Understand the sequence of steps that happen. You are not expected to understand every tiny detail in these (you have an entire course in 2-2 to take care of this). Your primary aim for now is to know how to use them when you see the need for them.

I am, however, assuming you know what a database is and when it will be needed. If you don't, go ahead and open these links. The Introduction/Overview sections and the examples will give you an informal idea about databases.

#Databases/SQL

2. http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/

#JDBC
1. http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/fcdb/oracle/or-jdbc.html (focus on explanations and the process outline)
2. http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jdbc/ (understand what the code does )

#H2
3. http://www.claudiobernasconi.ch/2010/08/17/h2-embedded-java-db-getting-started/ (simple code to understand the basic idea)
4. http://www.javatips.net/blog/2014/07/h2-database-example

H2 more or less follows the same sequence of stepsÂ as JDBC.

MongoDB:

4. http://www.w3resource.com/mongodb/introduction-mongodb.php

MongoDB is one of the newer database systems and is different from SQL. These links have enough material to appease (and probably saturate) your curiosity about MongoDB.
