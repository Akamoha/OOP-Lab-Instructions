First of all, Go through the eBay website - www.eBay.in 
DO NOT INCLUDE THE FEATURES OF PAYPAL INC. , THEY ARE NOT A PART OF EBAY ANYMORE.

->Go through Akshay Damle's video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCihy1nZ7Io and 
  Anshul's guidelines - https://github.com/Akamoha/OOP-Resources/tree/master/Projects/Group%20videochat%20webapp
  
->Note down the different funcationalities of eBay. You are free to include new ideas in your project, 
  but please send a text file containing your new ideas to my email - f2013037@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in 
  and get it approved. 

->Learn UML thoroughly. If you find the explanations in Booch book difficult, then try this:
  http://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy252/references/UML_for_Java_Programmers-Book.pdf
  It gives a relatively easier explanation from Java's perspective. Go through the Booch book after
  understanding the concepts in this book clearly.

->Please do not search for "eBay use case" or "eBay class diagram" on google and blindly copy it. 

->You are are free to use any software you want to draw the UML diagrams, 
  but the final diagram should be saved a PNG or a JPEG file

->Start working ASAP, Dont postpone your work to the final week. Good luck!

I will post regarding all the frameworks that are expected to be used in this project in the next few days. 
Feel free to drop a mail if you have any queries. You will get a reply asap. Good luck!
